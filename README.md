This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

- This is **a contact book project to facilitate handling of contacts for NUS student leaders**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - as an application to characterize different vendors
  - as a way to store contact details for future references
  - as a way to filter and search for specific contacts efficiently
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _LinkedUp_) used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 7 KLoC) than typical contact applications, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- It is named `LinkedUp` because it we want to achieve the same network system as **Linked**In while **Up**holding simplicity and accessibility in our app.
- For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[LinkedUp Developer Guide](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-w09-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)**.
